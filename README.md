# Wicked Cocktails

## Welcome!

No need to fumble through sites or apps to find the perfect drinks for your next get together. Search thousands of cocktail recipes by name or ingredients with Wicked Cocktails.

## How it Works

Use the search bar to genertate cocktail recipes by matching name or ingredient key words. (e.g. bloody will match bloody mary and bloody margarita). Every search returns drinks containing those key words, as well as all the recipes and instructions to make the drink yourself. Seperate words with commas to search multiple keywords.

## User Stories
- As a user I would like to make a search using few words, to return multiple drink recipes.
- I would like to be able to start a new search if I am unable to find the recipe I am searching for.
- If I find a recipe that interests me, I would like to be able to save that recipe to my favorites for future use.
- If I later decide I no longer want to keep a recipe in my favorites, I would like to be able to delete it.

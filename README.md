## Welcome!

No need to fumble through sites or apps to find the perfect drinks for your next get together. Search thousands of cocktail recipes by name or ingredients with Wicked Cocktails.

## How it Works

To get started, simply use the search bar to generate a list of cocktail recipes by matching either the name or ingredients of the drink you are looking for. For example, if you search for "bloody," you will get a list of drinks that contain the word "bloody" in their name, such as the classic Bloody Mary and the tasty Bloody Margarita.

But the search function doesn't stop there! You can also use it to find cocktails based on specific ingredients by separating the keywords with commas. So if you want to find a drink that includes vodka and cranberry juice, simply search for "vodka, cranberry" and you will get a list of cocktails that match those ingredients.

Every search result includes not only the name of the cocktail, but also the full recipe and instructions on how to make it yourself at home. This way, you can easily mix up your own delicious drinks without having to worry about trying to remember the recipe or proportions.

And if you don't want to forget about all the amazing cocktails you've found and want to save them for later, you can create a login to save your favorite mixes to your own personal favorites list. This way, you can easily access all your go-to drinks in one convenient place. So go ahead and give it a try â€“ you'll be mixing up delicious cocktails in no time!

## Post-Project Reflection

What my project was:

My project was a web application that allows users to search for and save cocktail recipes. The application connects to a third-party API to retrieve the recipes and uses a local database to store user information, saved cocktails, and comments.

What I enjoyed:

I enjoyed the process of building the web application and learning about the different technologies used (Express, EJS, and Sequelize). It was nice to see the application come together and be able to use it myself. I was able to use some features and methods from previous projects and deliverables and implement them into my project.

What I found difficult:

The most difficult part initally was connecting to the third-party API and properly formatting the data to be stored in the local database. I tried a few different API sources and it took some trial and error to get everything working correctly.

What worked well for me:

I found that breaking the project down into smaller tasks and tackling them one at a time helped me to stay focused and make progress. Working a little everyday helped me not feel like I was falling behind on my tasks. I also found it helpful to refer back to previous deliverables and projects.

Things I would do next time:

Next time, I would try to plan out the structure and organization of my project in more detail before diving in. I think this would help me to better understand the required views and routes before hand. My project isnt as D.R.Y. as it could be when it comes to the ejs. files. For this project, it works. But I can see how expanding on this project would make it a challenge to understand and maintain in the future.

Unsolved problems:
I would like to find a way to improve the favorite function so that when a user favorites a cocktail, they can continue to favorite multiple cocktails from the same search, until they are ready to make another search, or view their favorites. At the moment, the page refreshes and clears the search results with each facorite.

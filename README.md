# Wicked Cocktails

## Welcome!

No need to fumble through sites or apps to find the perfect drinks for your next get together. Search thousands of cocktail recipes by name or ingredients with Wicked Cocktails.

## How it Works

Use the search bar to genertate cocktail recipes by matching name or ingredient key words. (e.g. bloody will match bloody mary and bloody margarita). Every search returns drinks containing those key words, as well as all the recipes and instructions to make the drink yourself. Seperate words with commas to search multiple keywords.
